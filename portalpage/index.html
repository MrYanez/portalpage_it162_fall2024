        <p>My name is <strong>Nahum Yanez</strong>, and <strong>I love IT.</p></strong>
            <p>
            I was born and raised, both my childhood
            and adolescence in Mexico, and I have lived in Seattle Washington for the past 15 years.</p>
            <p>Growth is always a priority for me, so I am always looking for ways to keep my self and mind
            occupied in doing the things that benefit me in some more than ways.
            In my spare time, I like to read, to cook, to watch the news, and 
            to enjoy of myself and solitude.</p>
            <p>Academically, I attended Seattle Central College where I completed my:
            ESL, ABE, GED, and a 2-year transfer degree in Global Studies. After this, I completed a 2-year
            college degree from Mexico via online through the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). 
            Similarly, I completed 3 semesters 
            from the same University in Political Sciences.</p>
            <p>Also, I am about to complete a 2-year college transfer degree in Application Development
            at North Seattle College; nonetheless, I also registered at Seattle Central College to pursue
            the 90-credit certificate in website development. My goal is to gain experience
            working both as a back-end and front-end application and website development.
            I highly believe that both skills are essential in the world of technology to efficiently
            know how to manage new technologies.</p>
            <p>My short-term goal is to complete my 2-year website application certificate and application degree, to then
            take a bacherlor's degree in Application Development so that I can join the workforce industry
            and work for a technology company to put into practice and already education while continuing
            develop hands-on work and some other valuable and on demand IT skills.</p>
